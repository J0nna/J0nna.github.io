## Command line tools for linguists

This course gives a student the basic knowledge of how to operate Unix-like command line environments. It focuses especially on functions that are useful for linguists.

According to the course description on [WebOodi](https://weboodi.helsinki.fi/hy/opettaptied.jsp?MD5avain=cd20e682-4d26-47f7-81e0-4dcd16ccee9e&Kieli=1&OpetTap=129824412&takaisin=omatopinn.jsp&NaytIlm=1&NaytSuor=0&NaytSuun=0&NaytHyl=0), the students who take this course learn to:
* operate in a Unix-like environment.
* use Unix command-line on a Windows or Mac OSX computer.
* use the Unix command-line.
* use regular expressions.
* processing corpora at a basic level.
* run programs from the command-line.
* install programs.
* write basic scripts.
* use version control tools.
* work on a remote server.
* create and host a webpage on GitHub Pages.
* _and most importantly_ stay calm and google when things go wrong.

#### Week 1

##### Introduction to Command Line Environments

The first week of the course was about a brief theoretical introduction to command line, computer architecture and operating systems, setting up the command line environments on students' personal computers and learning the first basic commands. 

#### Week 2

##### Navigating a UNIX System

During the second week of the course we learned to navigate around the Unix system copying, moving and deleting directories and compressing files. We connected to a remote server for the first time.

> In my opinion this was the most difficult week of the course. 

#### Week 3

##### Basic Corpus Processing

Week 3 of the course taught us about the encoding systems and basic corpus processing. We learned, for example, to remove duplicate lines from a text file and to count words, characters or lines.  

#### Week 4

##### Advanced Corpus Processing

During the 4th week of the course we continued with the corpus processing. The most important things we learned were to generate frequency lists and n-grams.

> This was probably the most important week for all (future) linguists.

#### Week 5

##### Scripting and Configuration Files

We learned to modify existing scripts and to write some basic scripts ourselves.  

> I really liked writing scripts by myself during the quiz 5!

#### Week 6

##### Installing and Running Programs

This week we studied different ways of installing programs, softwares and packages. The use of sudo and other installation commands were explained. Also, we wrote our first Makefiles.

#### Week 7

##### Version Control

During the 7th week we set up Github accounts and learned a lot about the vesion control and the importance of it in developing projects.

#### Final assignment

For the final assignment of this course we created these websites by using Git.
