## Command line tools for linguists

This course gives a student the basic knowledge of how to operate Unix-like command line environments. It focuses especially on functions that are useful for linguists.

According to the course description on [WebOodi](https://weboodi.helsinki.fi/hy/opettaptied.jsp?MD5avain=cd20e682-4d26-47f7-81e0-4dcd16ccee9e&Kieli=1&OpetTap=129824412&takaisin=omatopinn.jsp&NaytIlm=1&NaytSuor=0&NaytSuun=0&NaytHyl=0), the students who take this course learn to:
* operate in a Unix-like environment.
* use Unix command-line on a Windows or Mac OSX computer.

* processing corpora at a basic level.
* run programs from the command-line.

#### Week 1

##### Introduction to Command Line Environments

The first week of the course was about a brief theoretical introduction to command line, computer architecture and operating systems, setting up the command line environments on students' personal computers and learning the first basic commands. 

#### Week 2

##### Navigating a UNIX System

During the second week of the course we learned to navigate around the Unix system copying, moving and deleting directories and compressing files. We connected to a remote server for the first time.

> In my opinion this was the most difficult week of the course.
